### How do I approach designing software?

I try to approach by coming up with a basic idea on paper. What I want it to do, who I am targeting, what features I think my target audience would enjoy, and how I can make it easy to modify. I think modularization and extensibility is most important to me right after a fun to use product. Everytime I make a new project I immediately think about how I can make packages, classes, and methods with names and functionality that have an obvious purpose to the entire workflow of the software.

### How do I approach developing programs?

I usually break down the program into tasks. Then I think about what features are most important, either because the rest of the program relies on those features or because they are most important to my audience. After that I think about how I can split up each task of that feature into methods that I can then write. Every time I write a significant change I test the code to make sure it works as intended. I do this until my project is complete.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science will help me reach my goals by giving me the solid foundation that I need to explore and experience all different parts of the software development lifecycle as well as IT related information that I need to know to be a valuable asset to the industry. Although personal projects reinforce the learning, it is important that I get a good introduction into the most important technologies that companies are using today. If I know what to expect before I go into the industry then I have a better chance of growing at a faster rate and doing something more important for the industry.
